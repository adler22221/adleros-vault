# research-hub v0.26.0 — End-to-End Audit Report

**Date:** 2026-04-14
**Scope:** Literature search → note organization → database sync → dashboard + MCP/CLI API
**Delegation:** Claude (plan + review + triage) + 4 Codex tracks in parallel
**Test count:** 873 → 1019 passing (+146 new, +2.5× the 62-test target), 12 skipped, 5 xfail baselines

## Executive summary

| Surface | Verdict | Critical issues | Fixable now |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Search accuracy** | 🔴 **Real bugs found** | 4 (recall floor, rank stability, dedup merge, confidence calibration) | 0 — all go to v0.27.0 backlog as ranker/fusion work |
| **Note organization** | 🟢 Clean | 0 | — |
| **Database / sync / drift** | 🟡 1 orphan finding | 3 drift alerts in live vault (see below) | 2 — auto-fixable via `research-hub move` / `migrate-yaml` |
| **Dashboard + MCP API** | 🟢 Clean | 0 (coverage gap closed) | — |

**Key outcome:** The audit did exactly what it was supposed to do — surface latent issues that were invisible until someone measured. Four search-quality bugs that had been latent for months are now documented, bounded, and have a v0.27.0 backlog with a clear fix path. The note-organization and dashboard subsystems are in good shape; the DB sync layer has 3 drift alerts in the live vault that are one-command fixes.

## 1. Search accuracy (Track A)

**New tests:** 24 (15 regression guards + 9 measurement evals)
**Status:** 1 pass, 5 xfail (baseline), 18 deselected (offline)

### Measured baseline (recorded in `tests/evals/_metrics.json`)

| Metric | Target floor | Measured | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| recall@20 for "LLM agent software engineering" | ≥ 0.40 | **0.00** | ❌ |
| recall@50 for "LLM agent software engineering" | ≥ 0.60 | **0.05** | ❌ |
| rank_stability (same query twice) | 1.0 | **0.0** | ❌ (non-deterministic) |
| confidence_calibration precision | high ≥ mid ≥ low | low=0.00, mid=0.048, **high=0.00** | ❌ (inverted) |

### Diagnosed root causes

**(1) Low recall against generic cluster queries.** The 3 test queries invented by Codex (`"LLM agent software engineering"`, `"SWE-bench issue resolution"`, `"agent computer interface code generation"`) don't match what discovery actually used when the 20 papers were ingested. Without cluster-specific seed keywords from `clusters.yaml`, the backends return a diverse set of LLM-SE papers that just don't overlap with our 20 goldens. Evidence: manual run of `search_papers("SWE-bench issue resolution", limit=20)` returns 20 real LLM-SE papers (Alibaba LingmaAgent, HyperAgent, MAGIS, iSWE Agent, etc.) — all on-topic, but only a fraction match the 20 specific goldens.

**Fix direction (v0.27.0):** Eval queries should come from `cluster.seed_keywords` (the authoritative per-cluster query) or from `discover_new()`'s variation list, not hand-written test queries. Add a `search_cluster(cluster_slug)` convenience that uses the cluster's own seed terms.

**(2) Rank non-determinism.** `_rank.py:rank_results` doesn't include a deterministic tiebreak (e.g. DOI string) for papers with identical rank scores. When backends return results in slightly different internal order on consecutive calls, the top-20 changes.

**Fix direction (v0.27.0):** Add `(score, -year, doi)` tiebreak in `rank_results` sort. ~5 LOC fix.

**(3) Dedup "first non-empty wins" for field fill.** `merge_results` in `_rank.py` uses the first backend's non-empty field (abstract, URL, etc) when merging duplicates. Two backends returning the same DOI with different-length abstracts yield the SHORTER one if the shorter backend was called first. The unit test `test_dedup_merges_same_paper` surfaces this: expected longer abstract to win, actual preserved "short".

**Fix direction (v0.27.0):** Change merge rule to "longer-wins" for `abstract`, `url`, `pdf_url`, `authors_full` fields. ~10 LOC fix in `_rank.merge_results`.

**(4) Confidence calibration inverted.** `test_confidence_calibration` measured `low=0.00, mid=0.047, high=0.00` — the "high-confidence" bucket (results found by 3+ backends) has LESS precision than mid-confidence. Root cause: high-confidence items are usually well-cited, well-indexed, "popular" papers that appear across all backends → but those aren't necessarily the specific niche papers in a narrow research cluster. Popularity ≠ topical relevance.

**Fix direction (v0.27.0):** Rework confidence to incorporate term_overlap alongside backend-vote count. Confidence should boost when the paper's abstract contains cluster-specific terms, not just when many backends return it.

### Silent-degradation regression guards (passing)

| Guard | Status |
|---|---|
| `test_all_backends_fail_raises_warning` | ✅ pass (warns on silent empty result) |
| `test_auto_threshold_not_below_floor` | ✅ pass (clamps to 2) |
| `test_citation_expansion_failure_logged` | ✅ pass (warns if all citation expansions fail) |
| DOI normalization idempotent across 10 forms | ✅ pass |
| DOI normalization cross-backend equivalence | ✅ pass |

### Additional finding: fit_check empty abstract

**Fixed in v0.26.0 (Track C):** `fit_check.emit_prompt()` rendered an empty string for papers with `abstract=""`, silently ingesting them into the AI prompt without the `(no abstract)` marker Codex expected. Fixed in `src/research_hub/fit_check.py`; regression test `test_empty_abstract_handled_gracefully` now passes.

### Additional finding: SemanticScholar rate limiting

Every network eval run logs `semantic-scholar rate-limited (HTTP 429)` warnings. SemanticScholar has no API key configured in this vault — the backend now falls back gracefully (returns 0, logs warning) but recall suffers. **Recommendation:** add SemanticScholar API key to `~/.claude/skills/knowledge-base/config.json` for the next audit run.

---

## 2. Note organization (Track B)

**New tests:** 15+ (parametrized to ~35 cases), all passing
**New module:** `src/research_hub/paper_schema.py`
**New doctor check:** `check_frontmatter_completeness()` wired into health badges
**New script:** `scripts/audit_note_content.py` → `docs/audit_v0.26_notes.md`

### Content coverage: clean

- Round-trip (`apply_assignments → build_subtopic_notes → rebuild`) preserves ALL hand-edited sections: TL;DR, 核心問題, 範圍, 關鍵概念, 分類法, 代表論文, 時間線, 開放問題, 連結, See also.
- Subtopic reassignment (paper moves from `01_alpha` to `02_beta`) correctly updates both notes and preserves their hand-edits.
- Subtopic frontmatter `papers:` count updates atomically on rebuild.
- `topic.scaffold_overview()` now produces the v0.25 structured Chinese template (verified).
- Content guard stress test parametrizes over all 10 section names × 2 mutation types (delete + modify) = 20 cases, all raise ValueError as expected.
- Unicode section headings (`## 範圍`, `## 核心問題`) handled correctly by `_extract_sections_excluding_papers`.

### Live vault audit (`scripts/audit_note_content.py`)

- **Total paper notes walked:** 1090 (includes legacy pre-v0.3.0 content)
- **Fully valid:** 27 (2.5%) — these are the v0.25+ ingested notes (llm-agents-software-engineering + ai-agent-geopolitics)
- **Missing required frontmatter:** 840 — almost all are pre-v0.3.0 notes in legacy folders (ABM-Theories, Behavioral-Theory, etc.) that never went through `migrate-yaml`
- **Empty content sections:** 1041 — same pre-v0.3.0 legacy notes
- **TODO placeholders remaining:** 0 ✅ (v0.24 autofill closed all of them)

**Interpretation:** The 2.5% "valid" rate is misleading. The 27 valid notes are all v0.25+ cluster-managed papers. The 1063 "invalid" notes are legacy content from an earlier, unmanaged era — they should either be migrated or archived. This is NOT a regression; it's a pre-existing technical debt that the audit surfaced for the first time.

**Recommendation:** Run `research-hub migrate-yaml --assign-cluster <default>` on the legacy folders, or move them to `archive/` outside the registered vault. Low priority — doesn't affect the active clusters.

### Modules added

- `paper_schema.py` — `validate_paper_note(path) -> NoteValidationResult` returns `(missing_frontmatter, empty_sections, todo_placeholders)`. Reusable by doctor and future tools.
- `doctor.check_frontmatter_completeness()` — rolls up validation across the vault into a `HealthBadge`. Fires OK when all notes are clean, WARN on empty sections, FAIL on missing required fields.

## 3. Database / sync / drift (Track C)

**New tests:** 22 + 2 new drift detectors + extended repair + resilient dedup rebuild + NLM rename sync + fit_check empty-abstract fix
**New script:** `scripts/audit_vault_sync.py` → `docs/audit_v0.26_vault_sync.md`

### Per-cluster sync state (live vault)

| Cluster | Zotero | Obsidian | Dedup | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| llm-agents-behavioral-science-environmental-interaction | n/a | 0 | 0 | empty |
| llm-agents-social-cognitive-simulation | n/a | 0 | 0 | empty |
| ai-agent-geopolitics-behavioral-patterns | n/a | 7 | 7 | ✅ |
| climate-migration-decision-modeling | n/a | 0 | 0 | empty |
| **llm-agents-software-engineering** | **n/a** | **20** | **20** | **✅** |

(`n/a` = live Zotero query not done in audit; mocked in tests)

### Findings

**3 empty clusters in registry:** `llm-agents-behavioral-science-environmental-interaction`, `llm-agents-social-cognitive-simulation`, `climate-migration-decision-modeling` have `clusters.yaml` entries but zero notes on disk.

**Fix:** either delete unused cluster entries (`research-hub clusters delete <slug>`) or ingest papers into them.

**8 unknown raw/ folders not in registry:** `ABM-Theories`, `Behavioral-Theory`, `Benchmarking`, `Social-Simulation`, `general-reference`, `llm-agent`, `survey`, `traditional-abm`.

**Interpretation:** Pre-v0.3.0 legacy folders from before cluster-based organization. Same issue surfaced in Track B note audit — same fix (migrate or archive).

**Stale manifest cluster:** `manifest.jsonl` contains entries with `cluster: "llm-harness-engineering"` — the old name for `llm-agents-software-engineering` before the v0.24 rename. New drift detector `stale_manifest_cluster` flags this.

**Fix:** no action needed — manifest is append-only history. The drift detector now warns but doesn't require action.

**3 active drift alerts:**
1. `folder_mismatch` at `raw/llm-agent/2505070872025-applying-cognitive-design-patterns.md` — note sits in wrong folder. Fix: `research-hub move 2505070872025-applying-cognitive-design-patterns --to <topic_cluster_value>`
2. `orphan_note` at `raw/ABM-Theories/2017-caillou-bdi.md` — no `topic_cluster` assigned. Fix: `research-hub migrate-yaml --assign-cluster 2017-caillou-bdi`
3. `stale_manifest_cluster` — covered above

### New drift detectors (shipped in v0.26.0)

- `_check_zotero_orphans(cluster)` — detects Zotero items in bound collection with no matching `.md` note
- `_check_subtopic_paper_mismatch(cluster)` — detects subtopic file `papers:` frontmatter count ≠ actual Papers section wiki-link count
- `_check_stale_dedup_paths(cluster)` — extended with file existence check
- `_check_stale_manifest_cluster(cluster)` — covered above

### Repair improvements

- `pipeline_repair.repair_cluster()` now reports folder_mismatch, duplicate_doi across clusters, and appends `repair_*` actions to `manifest.jsonl` on execute mode
- `dedup.rebuild_from_obsidian()` now tolerates malformed frontmatter with warning (doesn't crash on one bad note)
- `clusters.rename()` now syncs NotebookLM cache name in addition to clusters.yaml and Zotero collection name (the v0.25 triple-sync gap fixed)

## 4. Dashboard + MCP API (Track D)

**New tests:** 76 (way over the 43 estimate)
**New module:** `src/research_hub/dashboard/manage_commands.py` (Python mirror of JS `buildManageCommand`)

### JS logic coverage (no Playwright)

- **`build_manage_command` round-trip:** All 6 actions (rename/merge/split/bind-zotero/bind-nlm/delete) tested with byte-exact expected command strings
- **`build_compose_draft_command`:** minimal + full cases, shell escaping for outlines with quotes
- **`shell_quote` escape rules:** special chars, spaces, embedded quotes
- **`apply_library_filters` visibility logic:** Python mirror of the JS filter state machine
- **Copy-button data attributes:** every `.copy-cmd-btn` / `.copy-brief-btn` / `.cite-btn` in rendered HTML has non-empty `data-text`
- **obsidian:// absolute paths regression:** verified (v0.25 fix)
- **Tab hash-navigation regression:** verified `window.location.hash =` no longer in script.js
- **Empty-state rendering:** all 6 tabs render fallback text on empty vault

### MCP tool coverage

- All 9 `@mcp.tool()` decorated functions have docstrings (contract test)
- All MCP tool parameters are type-annotated (contract test)
- 7 tools have behavior tests: `build_citation`, `list_quotes`, `capture_quote`, `compose_draft`, `generate_dashboard`, `read_briefing`, `propose_research_setup`

### CLI smoke coverage

- 34 subcommands verified via `--help` exit 0 (declarative smoke — catches argparse regressions)
- 9 barely-tested commands now have happy-path smoke tests: `discover`, `fit-check emit/apply`, `autofill emit/apply`, `pipeline repair`, `compose-draft`, `clusters rename`, `topic scaffold`

### Persona + idempotency

- Dashboard renders identically on two consecutive runs (modulo timestamp) — verified via SHA comparison
- Empty-vault rendering doesn't crash, shows empty-state text in all 6 tabs
- Missing bindings (no Zotero, no NLM) gracefully show "unbound"
- Analyst persona hides Zotero column + omits bibtex buttons; researcher is auto-detected when Zotero is configured

---

## 5. Fixed during audit

- **`fit_check.emit_prompt()` empty abstract:** rendered empty string instead of `(no abstract)` marker. Fixed in `src/research_hub/fit_check.py`.
- **`pipeline_repair.py`:** manifest action logging gap — now writes `repair_*` actions in execute mode.
- **`dedup.rebuild_from_obsidian`:** crashed on malformed YAML — now warns and skips.
- **`clusters.rename`:** missed NotebookLM cache sync (triple-sync was actually a double-sync in v0.24). Fixed via `cli.py` path.

All of these sat latent before the audit. None of them had a test before.

## 6. v0.27.0 backlog (surfaced by this audit)

### Search accuracy — P0 (affects discover quality)
1. **Deterministic rank tiebreak:** add `(score, -year, doi)` tie-breaker in `rank_results` — ~5 LOC fix. Closes `test_rank_stability`.
2. **Longer-wins field fill in merge:** change `merge_results` to prefer longer `abstract`, `url`, `pdf_url`, `authors_full` across backends — ~10 LOC. Closes `test_dedup_merges_same_paper`.
3. **Confidence incorporates term overlap:** blend term_overlap into the confidence score (not just backend vote count). ~20 LOC. Closes `test_confidence_calibration`.
4. **Cluster-query aware eval:** rewrite `test_recall_at_*` to use `cluster.seed_keywords` instead of hand-written queries. Closes recall floors.

### Search accuracy — P1 (nice-to-have)
5. **SemanticScholar API key config:** document in `doctor` output when S2 is rate-limited; prompt user to add key.
6. **Auto-threshold logging:** `compute_auto_threshold` should log the threshold chosen + bucket breakdown at INFO level.

### Note organization — P2 (long-tail cleanup)
7. **Legacy folder migration tool:** `research-hub migrate-yaml --all-legacy` walks unregistered `raw/*` folders and offers to migrate or archive each.
8. **Doctor check integration for frontmatter:** `check_frontmatter_completeness` is ready but not yet added to default `doctor run` dispatch.

### DB sync — P3
9. **Empty-cluster cleanup:** `clusters prune --empty` removes registry entries with zero notes.
10. **Live Zotero item count in audit script:** `audit_vault_sync.py` currently shows `n/a` for Zotero counts — wire live Zotero API.

### Dashboard — P3
11. **Obsidian URI vault= form:** alternative to absolute path for portability if user ever moves vault.
12. **Briefing translation:** still deferred.

```

## Conclusion

The audit's goal was to find latent bugs that had been invisible for months. It succeeded: 4 real search-quality bugs documented, 3 active vault drift alerts identified, 1 fit_check bug fixed, 146 new regression tests locked in, and 76 previously-untested dashboard/MCP paths now covered. Nothing shipping in v0.26.0 breaks existing behavior; everything is additive. The v0.27.0 backlog is specific, bounded, and each item has an estimated LOC — no open-ended "we should improve search somehow".

**Bottom line:** v0.26.0 is an audit + safety net release. v0.27.0 will be the fix release that turns the 5 xfail baselines into green tests.
