## Why this exists

Most research tools are good at one part of the workflow:

- Zotero stores citations, metadata, and PDFs.
- Obsidian stores notes, links, and synthesis.
- NotebookLM turns source bundles into AI-readable briefs.

The painful part is the handoff. research-hub connects those handoffs so an AI agent can search, ingest, tag, summarize, repair, brief, and inspect your workspace without turning your library into an opaque RAG box.

You do **not** need all three tools on day one.

| Your current stack | What research-hub gives you first |
|---|---|
| Zotero + Obsidian | Paper search, Zotero metadata, Markdown notes, tags, Obsidian Bases dashboards |
| Obsidian + NotebookLM | Local PDF/DOCX/MD/TXT ingest, cluster dashboards, NotebookLM bundles and briefs |
| Zotero + NotebookLM | Zotero-backed paper selection, namespaced tags, NotebookLM upload/generate/download |
| Zotero + Obsidian + NotebookLM | Full loop: discover -> ingest -> organize -> brief -> answer -> maintain |
| No accounts yet | Sample dashboard and local smoke tests before connecting anything |

---

## What it does

research-hub is a local-first orchestration layer for research workflows:

- **CLI:** `research-hub auto`, `import-folder`, `ask`, `doctor`, `tidy`, `clusters`, `zotero`, `notebooklm`, `crystal`, and more.
- **MCP server:** lets Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Continue.dev, Cline, Roo Code, OpenClaw, and other MCP hosts operate the same workflow.
- **REST API:** exposes `/api/v1/*` for browser-only or HTTP-capable assistants.
- **Dashboard:** gives humans a live view of clusters, papers, diagnostics, briefs, writing support, and management actions.
- **Vault format:** writes normal Markdown, frontmatter, `.base` dashboards, cache files, and logs that you can inspect directly.

The core loop:

```text
topic or source folder
  -> discover or import sources
  -> enrich metadata
  -> write Zotero tags/notes when enabled
  -> write Obsidian Markdown notes and cluster dashboards
  -> bundle/upload/generate with NotebookLM when enabled
  -> cache answers as crystals and structured memory
```

## Install + first run

### Option A: preview without accounts

```bash
pip install research-hub-pipeline
research-hub dashboard --sample
```

No Zotero, no NotebookLM, no API keys. This opens the end-state dashboard on a bundled sample vault.

### Option B: local-first Obsidian workflow

If you mainly use Obsidian and local files:

```bash
pip install research-hub-pipeline[import,secrets]
research-hub setup --persona analyst
research-hub import-folder ./papers --cluster my-local-review
research-hub serve --dashboard
```

Add NotebookLM later with `[playwright]` if you want browser-based brief generation.

### Option C: full Zotero + Obsidian + NotebookLM workflow

```bash
pip install research-hub-pipeline[playwright,secrets]
research-hub setup
research-hub auto "your research topic"
```

For a first smoke test without NotebookLM automation:

```bash
research-hub auto "your research topic" --no-nlm
```

### Let your AI install it

Paste this into Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Continue, ChatGPT, Gemini, or another shell-capable AI:

```text
Please install research-hub on my machine. It is a Python package that turns
Zotero, Obsidian, and NotebookLM into an AI-operable research workspace.

1. Check `python --version`. If it is below 3.10, tell me to upgrade first.
2. Run `pip install research-hub-pipeline[playwright,secrets]`.
3. Run `research-hub setup`. Stop and pass me the prompts as they appear.
   Answer the Zotero question on my behalf only if I already told you.
   Chrome-based NotebookLM login may open; I will finish it.
4. Ask me for a topic and run `research-hub auto "TOPIC"`.
```

| Persona | Best for | Install extra |
|---|---|---|
| Researcher | STEM papers, DOI/arXiv, Zotero-first workflows | `[playwright,secrets]` |
| Humanities | books, quotes, URL-only sources, Zotero + Obsidian | `[playwright,secrets]` |
| Analyst | industry research, local PDFs/reports, no Zotero required | `[import,secrets]` |
| Internal KM | lab/company knowledge bases, mixed file types | `[import,secrets]` |

Python 3.10+ is required. Optional extras: `[playwright]` for NotebookLM, `[import]` for local PDF/DOCX/MD/TXT/URL ingest, `[secrets]` for OS-keyring credential storage, `[mcp]` for MCP server dependencies.

## Connect your AI host

For Claude Desktop, Cursor, Continue.dev, Cline, VS Code Copilot, OpenClaw, or another MCP host:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "research-hub": { "command": "research-hub", "args": ["serve"] } } }
```

Restart the host. Then ask naturally:

> Find me 5 papers on agent-based modeling and put them in a notebook.

The AI can call `auto_research_topic(topic="agent-based modeling", max_papers=5)` and ingest papers, generate a NotebookLM brief, and update the vault.

Install host-specific skill files:

```bash
research-hub install --platform claude-code
research-hub install --platform cursor
research-hub install --platform codex
research-hub install --platform gemini
```

Browser-only or HTTP-capable AIs can use the REST API:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8765/api/v1/plan \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d "{\"intent\":\"research harness engineering\"}"
```

## Inside Obsidian

Every ingested paper becomes a real Markdown note with structured frontmatter. Every cluster can also get an Obsidian Bases dashboard.

**Cluster Bases dashboard**: generated `.base` file with sortable paper metadata.

<img src="docs/images/obsidian-bases-dashboard.png" alt="Obsidian Bases dashboard for a cluster" width="640">

**Per-paper note**: title, authors, year, DOI, Zotero key, tags, status, cluster, and verification metadata.

<img src="docs/images/obsidian-paper-note.png" alt="Single paper note rendered with Properties view" width="640">

Crystals are plain Markdown notes under `hub/<cluster>/crystals/*.md`, so they can be linked, searched, and read by MCP tools at very low token cost.

---

## Inside Zotero

Every ingested paper gets a namespaced tag set so you can filter your library by research-hub context:

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `research-hub` | Ingested through this pipeline |
| `cluster/<slug>` | Which research cluster the paper belongs to |
| `category/<arxiv-code>` | arXiv category like `cs.AI` or `econ.GN` |
| `type/<publication-type>` | `Review`, `JournalArticle`, etc. from Semantic Scholar |
| `src/<backend>` | Search backend that discovered it: `arxiv`, `semantic_scholar`, `crossref`, `zotero` |

Every paper can also get a child note with `Summary / Key Findings / Methodology / Relevance`, derived from the Obsidian frontmatter. Papers that were in Zotero before research-hub existed can be backfilled with:

```bash
research-hub zotero backfill --tags --notes --apply
```

---

## Feature matrix

| Capability | Command or MCP tool | Notes |

| Zotero hygiene | `research-hub zotero backfill --tags --notes [--apply]` | Fills missing tags and notes on legacy items |
| Cluster cascade delete | `research-hub clusters delete <slug> [--apply --force]` | Preview impact on Obsidian, Zotero, dedup, memory, and crystals |
| No-NotebookLM smoke test | `research-hub auto "topic" --no-nlm` | Validates search and vault ingest without browser automation |
| Local file ingest | `research-hub import-folder <folder> --cluster <slug>` | PDF, DOCX, MD, TXT, URL |
| Ad-hoc cluster Q&A | `research-hub ask <cluster> "question"` / `ask_cluster_notebooklm` | Top-level CLI takes cluster first, then question |

## vs alternatives

research-hub does not replace Zotero, Obsidian, or NotebookLM. It connects them so an AI agent can operate the workflow.

| What you can do | Zotero alone | NotebookLM alone | Generic RAG | Obsidian-Zotero plugin | research-hub |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Search arXiv + Semantic Scholar in one command | No | No | DIY | No | Yes |
| Ingest into Zotero and Obsidian and NotebookLM | No | No | DIY | Partial | Yes |
| AI brief from your collection | No | Manual | DIY | No | Yes |
| Cached canonical answers | No | No | Re-fetches | No | Yes |
| Structured memory layer | No | No | Usually chunks | No | Yes |
| Direct AI-agent control via MCP | No | No | DIY | No | Yes |
| Live dashboard with action buttons | No | No | No | No | Yes |
| Per-cluster Obsidian Bases dashboard | No | No | No | No | Yes |
| No OpenAI/Anthropic API key required | n/a | Yes | Usually no | n/a | Yes |
| Local-first vault you own | Partial | No | Depends | Yes | Yes |

The practical fit: research-hub is most useful if you already use at least two of Zotero, Obsidian, and NotebookLM and want your AI assistant to run the repetitive steps.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `research-hub init` reports Chrome warnings | Chrome is missing or patchright cannot find it | Install Chrome, then run `research-hub doctor` |
| `research-hub notebooklm login` opens a browser but Google blocks login | New-device or bot challenge | Complete the visible browser sign-in and phone challenge |
| `research-hub auto` finds 0 papers | Topic too narrow or search backend transient issue | Re-run with `--max-papers 20` or rephrase |
| NotebookLM upload or generate fails | NotebookLM UI changed or login expired | Run `research-hub notebooklm login`; then resume with `research-hub notebooklm bundle/upload/generate/download --cluster <slug>` |
| `auto --with-crystals` cannot find an LLM CLI | `claude`, `codex`, or `gemini` is not on PATH | Install one, or use `crystal emit` and `crystal apply` manually |
| Claude Desktop cannot see the MCP server | MCP config is in the wrong file or host was not restarted | Check the host config path and restart Claude Desktop |
| `init` reports Zotero warnings but you do not use Zotero | Persona expects Zotero | Re-run `research-hub setup --persona analyst` or `--persona internal` |
| `research-hub clusters delete` refuses to delete | Cluster has papers, notes, or Zotero items | Re-run with `--apply --force` after reviewing the cascade preview |
| `research-hub auto` errors "cluster already has N papers" | Cluster is non-empty and you ran `auto --cluster <slug>` without a flag | Add `--append` to add more, or `--force` to overwrite |
| Zotero items miss `research-hub` tags or notes | Items were created before v0.61 or pipeline failed mid-run | `research-hub zotero backfill --tags --notes --apply` |

For broader checks, run:

```bash
research-hub doctor --autofix
```
